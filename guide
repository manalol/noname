WHATS HAPPENING TO NONAME?
The external & internal cheats are being released after loader issues are being resolved.

WILL I NEED TO FORCE?
For the external cheat, you'll still need to force battleye but if you are using internal then it wont matter.

NEW FEATURES:
Internal
  - Name ESP
  - Ammo Count
  [+] Fixed rendering bug in cars and other vehicles
  
  [+] Aimbot changed from physical aim to memory (you can use your normal sens)
      - Make sure not to get reported, internals are sort of risky and if you use a low smoothing it will be VERY obvious
  [+] Fixed a bug where you snap onto players less farther than you
  [-] Removed neck aiming
  
 External:

  WHERE IS THE NEW EXTERNAL?
  The new external still uses the old loader so there is no need to reinstall
