WHATS HAPPENING TO NONAME?
The external & internal cheats are being released after loader issues are being resolved.

WILL I NEED TO FORCE?
For the external cheat, you'll still need to force battleye but if you are using internal then it wont matter.

NEW FEATURES:
Internal
  - Name ESP
  - Ammo Count
  [+] Fixed rendering bug in cars and other vehicles
  
  [+] Aimbot changed from physical aim to memory (you can use your normal sens)
      - Make sure not to get reported, internals are sort of risky and if you use a low smoothing it will be VERY obvious
  [+] Fixed a bug where you snap onto players less farther than you
  [-] Removed neck aiming
  
 External:
  ...
  
  WHERE IS THE NEW EXTERNAL?
  The new external still uses the old loader so there is no need to reinstall.
  
  I KEEP BSODING/CRASHING
  Loader issues are still being fixed but in the meantime please confirm that you're on windows versions 1903 to 21h1. DM the NoName bot $help for a 
  quick guide on how to launch the cheat.
